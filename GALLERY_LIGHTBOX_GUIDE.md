# Gallery Lightbox Feature - User Guide

## What's New? 🎉

Your gallery now has a professional lightbox feature that allows visitors to view images in full-size without any cropping!

---

## How It Works

### Viewing Images in Full-Size:

1. **Click any image** in the gallery
   - The image will open in a full-screen lightbox overlay
   - The complete image is displayed without cropping
   - Dark background focuses attention on the photo

2. **Navigate Between Images:**
   - Click the **◀ left arrow** button to see the previous image
   - Click the **▶ right arrow** button to see the next image
   - Or use your **keyboard arrow keys** (← →) to navigate
   - Navigation loops: after the last image, it goes back to the first

3. **Close the Lightbox:**
   - Click the **X button** in the top-right corner
   - Press the **ESC key** on your keyboard
   - Click anywhere **outside the image** (on the dark background)

4. **View Image Caption:**
   - Each image displays its caption at the bottom
   - Caption shows: "Deputy Principal", "Career Day", etc.
